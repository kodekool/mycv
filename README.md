# Welcome to my online resume üòÅ

In this repository, I created and designed my resume using BootStrap5, HTML, CSS and Javascript. There is a page that contains five sections about myself. IT contains significant details about me, IT-Skills, Education, Work experience and Online course certification. 

As a result of responsive design, my CV can be viewed on both desktop computers and mobile devices. Once the user scrolls down, the user will see an arrow icon at the right-bottom of the screen which allows them to navigate back to the top of the page. The scroll-up button works with JavaScript.


- Starting with About me, there is a short introduction and a read more button to see more details.
- In the IT Skills section, my current skills were rated individually using a progress bar. 
- Both the Education, Work experience and Student project sections are created with a table tag.
- In the last section, I presented my online certificate that I earned in the IT field using the list-groups template from Bootstrap.
